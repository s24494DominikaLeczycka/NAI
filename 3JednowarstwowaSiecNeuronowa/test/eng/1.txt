Riders Field is a baseball park in Frisco, Texas, United States. The home of the Frisco RoughRiders, a Double-A team of the Texas League, it opened on April 3, 2003, and can seat 10,216 people. Primarily a venue for Minor League Baseball games, the facility also hosts high school and college baseball tournaments and other public and private events. It has been the site of three Texas League All-Star Games. In his design, park architect David M. Schwarz desired the creation of a village-like "park within a (ball)park". The stadium received the 2003 Texas Construction award for Best Architectural Design. Attendance for RoughRiders games at the stadium has consistently placed first or second in the Texas League and at the Double-A classification since its opening. After having the second-highest attendance in its first two seasons, it had the highest in the league and classification from 2005 to 2019.
