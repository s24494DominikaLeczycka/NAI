Galle Lighthouse 	

The Galle Lighthouse is an onshore lighthouse in Galle, Sri Lanka. The oldest light station in the country, it is operated and maintained by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The first lighthouse in the area was built by the British in 1848 using cast-iron plates, but was destroyed by fire in 1936. The current 26.5-metre-high (87 ft) concrete lighthouse was built in 1939, around 100 metres (300 ft) from the original. This photograph of the Galle Lighthouse was taken in January 2020.
