Implement a perceptron that recognizes 2 classes.

Program arguments:

    path to the training file
    path to the test file
    learning rate
    number of epochs - one epoch is one iteration through all the training data

The perceptron is trained using the delta rule for several epochs on the training data, and then it is tested on the test data.
Report the accuracy on the test set after each epoch.

The training data can be shuffled after each epoch to achieve better results.

The program should be universal (similar to knn), it should work on any dimensions of numerical data except for the decision attribute, which can take exactly 2 nominal values.
No external libraries are allowed for mathematical operations. You can use libraries for data reading, preprocessing, storage, shuffling, etc.
Run the program on data from example2 and iris_perceptron separately.
